# ReactFormBuilder

ReactFormBuilder is a "JSON to Component app"

If you change the content of the data.data.js file, you will change the components on the page. The objective is to have everything done from the data.js but there is still some other code to generate the example page to be removed.

Please note that this is just a training project


## Dependencies
Using some nice stuff:

- Bulma css + bloomer components
- FontAwesome
- ReactDataSheets (https://nadbm.github.io/react-datasheet/)

- This example is also connected to one firebase firestore and uses it's auth method
